# SmartThingsEdgeDrivers
---
An extension of the preliminary edge driver originally established by [ryanjmulder](https://community.smartthings.com/u/ryanjmulder) and forked from [his GitHub repo](https://github.com/ryanjmulder/smartthings-edge-drivers).

The goal of these drivers is to include the unique HomeSeer Z-Wave attributes not currently accounted for in the [SmartThingsCommunity/SmartThingsEdgeDrivers](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/SmartThingsEdgeDrivers).

## Post Invite Activities

After accepting this channel invite and enrolling, any HomeSeer switches you add should automatically be assigned this Edge Driver.

To see if a switch is using this device driver, go to Devices, open the switch and click the "..." button. If "Driver" is in the list, then it's using the new Edge Driver code. The driver name will be "HomeSeer Z-Wave Switches". If "Driver" is not present, it's using the legacy Groovy Device Type Handler (DTH). In this case you should remove the device and re-add it.

### Removing the old handler

When removing the device via the SmartThings app, it will prompt you to follow your manufacturer's directions to exclude the old device. Once the exclusion process is started by the app, single click and release the rocker switch.

## Assigning multi-tap actions

To react to a multi-tap event, go to Automation and create a Routine. Under "If", choose "Device status", choose the switch and it should show all of the multi-tap events you can react to. Then you can add the result as normal for the routine.
