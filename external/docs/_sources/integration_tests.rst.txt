Integration Tests
=================

These modules are built with the intent to provide a way to run a series of tests for drivers in
an environment that mimics the driver running on the hub.  It is important to note that these are NOT
unit tests.  Specifically these will heavily leverage the SmartThings Lua libraries, and thus
potential bugs in those libraries could cause failures.  See the testing guide in the guides section
of the SmartThings documentation for more details on how to use these modules to build tests.
