Matter Driver Capability Defaults
=================================

Within the :doc:`MatterDriver <driver>` you will be registering a number of ``matter_handlers`` which
handle incoming Matter interaction response from a device.  Provided within the library are a number of default
implementations that follow the natural mapping of "Matter cluster interaction -> SmartThings capability event".  These
can either be manually referenced from your driver by simply requiring the correct default file, or you can have all
the defaults registered by making a call to
``register_for_default_handlers(driver_template, { capabilities.switch, capabilities.switchLevel })`` listing all the
capabilities you are interested in registering the default handlers for.

Each Matter defaults file will be named according to the single SmartThings capability it is providing defaults for, and
will contain several key components.

Any Matter message or capability command handlers that are specific to the capability will be defined within the
file. These functions will be one of the :doc:`Matter handlers <matter_message_handlers>` for messages from the device
or capability handlers for capability commands.  The number and types that are present are entirely dependent on the
Matter to SmartThings mapping and thus will vary depending on the capability.

Various ``subscribed_attributes`` and ``subscribed_events`` lists are defined which will be included in the driver
template. These list out all the attribute and event cluster elements that a device will need to subscribe to in order to
properly support the capability.
