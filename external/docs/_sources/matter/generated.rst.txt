Generated Matter Code
=====================

The matter cluster library makes interaction objects easier to work with
by providing cluster-defined structure, enum, and bitmap types, providing cluster
constants, providing APIs for building InteractionRequests, and providing APIs for
building test interaction Response objects for driver tests. It is generated from a
zcl xml definition that exists in the ``project-chip/connectedhomeip`` repo.
